# Data_Physicalization_App
This app is to manage physical data visualization representing for team productivities.

Background Working as a team, every team member needs to contribute their work to the total team project. This app will be connected with a physical gumball machine run by Arduino to help visualizing the progress of the team
About the app Prototype of the app: https://www.figma.com/proto/Eplcz8tadD8UhmpSLCvMrP/Research-app?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=60%3A425&viewport=141%2C163%2C0.13&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=3%3A4
The app will be a place where Team Leader can register to set up the physical system for their team member to work. Then team member will go in their dashboard and view the assigned task. Once they complete, they will go to drop the balls in the gumball machine by clicking drop on the app. The number of balls drop represents for the amount of work they have worked on the assigned tasks.

This is currently at the early stage of the project, therefore, most of the feature has not been implemented yet. User can just be able to register their account and sign in.
